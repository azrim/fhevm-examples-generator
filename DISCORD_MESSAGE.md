Hi! I submitted my **FHEVM Examples Generator** project for the December 2025 bounty.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/azrim/fhevm-examples-generator

**Issue:** I created a demo video as required by the bounty guidelines, but I accidentally forgot to include the video link in the submission form. The form doesn't allow resubmission or editing.

**Demo Video:** The video is now available and plays directly at the top of the README:
https://github.com/azrim/fhevm-examples-generator

**Documentation:** I've added a SUBMISSION_NOTE.md file explaining the situation in detail.

**Project Status:**
✅ Submitted on time (December 6, 2025)
✅ 8 working examples with 60+ passing tests
✅ Complete automation and documentation
✅ All bounty requirements met
✅ Demo video created and accessible

The only issue was the administrative oversight of not including the video link in the submission form. I apologize for this mistake and hope the submission can still be considered given that:
- The work was completed on time
- The demo video exists and is accessible
- All deliverables exceed the requirements

**Contact:**
- GitHub: azrim
- Discord: azrim89

Thank you for your understanding! 🙏
