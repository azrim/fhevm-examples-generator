# Submission Note - Demo Video

**Date:** December 7, 2025
**Repository:** https://github.com/azrim/fhevm-examples-generator
**Bounty:** Build the FHEVM Example Hub - December 2025

## Important Notice

This project was submitted to the Zama Bounty Program on **December 6, 2025** (before the deadline).

### Demo Video Situation

A demonstration video was created as required by the bounty guidelines. However, due to an oversight, the video link was **not included in the initial submission form**.

The submission form does not allow resubmission or editing after submission.

### Demo Video Availability

The demo video is now available and prominently linked in this repository:

- **Location in README**: Top of README.md file (plays inline)
- **Video Link**: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f3389b8-e7be-4cb2-ab7a-89df8d7ff2ed
- **Video File**: The original `demo.mp4` file is available upon request (not committed to repo due to size)

### What the Demo Shows

The 2-minute video demonstrates:

1. ✅ Project setup and installation
2. ✅ Scaffolding a single example
3. ✅ Running tests successfully
4. ✅ Scaffolding all 8 examples
5. ✅ Viewing results and deliverables
6. ✅ Key features overview
