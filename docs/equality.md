# Equality Comparison Test Suite

This test suite demonstrates equality and comparison operations on encrypted integers using FHEVM

## Comparison Operations

### Contract Compilation

> **Note:** Verifies that the Equality contract compiles successfully

## Deployment

### Deploy Equality Contract

> **Note:** Tests deployment of the equality comparison contract

## Equality Operations

### Test Equality Function

### Test Inequality Function

> **Note:** Tests the isEqual() function with encrypted inputs

> **Note:** Tests the isNotEqual() function with encrypted inputs

## Conditional Selection

### Test Select Function

> **Note:** Demonstrates selecting between two values based on encrypted condition

## Result Retrieval

### Get Comparison Result

> **Note:** Shows how to retrieve the encrypted comparison result

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run tests
npm test

# Or compile only
npx hardhat compile
```
